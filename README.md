# Phage Genomic Analysis Platform

A full-stack, AI-powered platform for automated bacterial genome analysis. This tool streamlines the end-to-end workflow for researchers‚Äîfetching genome sequences, annotating them, detecting antibiotic resistance genes, screening for prophages, and exporting structured results‚Äîdramatically reducing the need for manual processing.

---

## üö® Problem Statement

Researchers currently face a slow, error-prone process when analyzing bacterial genomes:

- Manual downloading of genome sequences from databases like **NCBI**.
- Conversion to coding sequences and running through tools such as **ResFinder**.
- Manual extraction and classification of resistance genes by drug class (e.g., tetracycline, beta-lactams).
- Exporting processed data manually into Excel or CSV.
- Repeating the entire process again for prophage detection using other tools.

## ‚úÖ Proposed Solution

This platform provides an **automated, AI-driven** solution to streamline this process:

- **Genome fetching**, **annotation**, **resistance gene detection**, and **prophage prediction**.
- **Integrated machine learning models** for enhanced prediction.
- Clean, interactive **frontend interface**.
- Results displayed in structured tables and exportable to Excel or CSV.

## üöÄ Stepwise Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Genome Upload or Accession Input
- Accept genome accession numbers or upload FASTA files.
- Automatically fetch genome data from NCBI.

### Step 2: Annotation and Resistance Gene Detection
- Annotate genomes using **Prokka**.
- Detect resistance genes with **ResFinder**.

### Step 3: Resistance Gene Classification
- Classify detected genes into drug categories (e.g., tetracycline, beta-lactams).
- Output structured in easily readable tables.

### Step 4: Prophage Detection
- Use **PHASTER** or internal ML models to predict prophages.
- Return detailed prophage data.

### Step 5: Export Results
- Display organized resistance gene and prophage tables in the UI.
- Allow export to **Excel** or **CSV** formats.

### Step 6: Optional Feedback Loop
- Allow labs to upload validation results.
- Feed this data back into model training to continuously improve prediction accuracy.
